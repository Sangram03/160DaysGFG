Your implementation of the `sumClosest` function seems to attempt finding a pair of numbers in the array `arr` such that:

1. Their sum is closest to the given `target`.
2. In case of a tie (two sums equally close to the target), the pair with the **largest absolute difference** is chosen.

However, there are a few things to review and clarify:
- **Logic for `maxAbsDiff`:** The way you compare `arr[right] - arr[left]` assumes that the array is sorted and that larger absolute differences are preferred when the closest sums are equal. This logic works only under those assumptions.
- **Result when `arr.length < 2`:** Returning an empty list is fine, but you might also want to throw an exception or handle it differently depending on requirements.

### Optimized and Corrected Code

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> sumClosest(int[] arr, int target) {
        if (arr.length < 2) {
            return new ArrayList<>();
        }
        Arrays.sort(arr); // Sort the array to use two-pointer technique
        int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
        int closestSum = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int maxAbsDiff = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        while (left < right) {
            int sum = arr[left] + arr[right];
            
            // Check if this sum is closer to the target or has a larger absolute difference
            if (Math.abs(target - sum) < Math.abs(target - closestSum) || 
                (Math.abs(target - sum) == Math.abs(target - closestSum) && (arr[right] - arr[left] > maxAbsDiff))) {
                closestSum = sum;
                maxAbsDiff = arr[right] - arr[left];
                result = Arrays.asList(arr[left], arr[right]);
            }
            
            // Move pointers
            if (sum < target) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Key Points:
1. **Sorting the Array:** Ensures the two-pointer approach works correctly.
2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the array has fewer than two elements, return an empty list.
   - Handles cases where multiple pairs may have the same closest sum.
3. **Tie-Breaker with `maxAbsDiff`:** Chooses the pair with the largest difference when sums are equally close.

### Example Usage

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] arr = {10, 22, 28, 29, 30, 40};
        int target = 54;
        System.out.println(sol.sumClosest(arr, target)); // Output: [22, 30]
    }
}
```

This implementation adheres to the problem's requirements and performs efficiently with \(O(n \log n)\) time complexity due to sorting, followed by an \(O(n)\) two-pointer traversal.
