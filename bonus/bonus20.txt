Minimum days to make M bouquets
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 46.85%Submissions: 15K+Points: 4
You have a row of flowers, where each flower blooms after a specific day. The array arr represents the blooming schedule: arr[i] is the day the flower at position i will bloom. To create a bouquet, you need to collect k adjacent bloomed flowers. Each flower can only be used in one bouquet.

Your goal is to find the minimum number of days required to make exactly m bouquets. If it is not possible to make m bouquets with the given arrangement, return -1.

Examples:
Input: m = 3, k = 2, arr[] = [3, 4, 2, 7, 13, 8, 5]
Output: 8
Explanation: We need 3 bouquets and each bouquet should have 2 flowers. After day 8: [x, x, x, x, _, x, x], we can make first bouquet from the first 2 flowers, second bouquet from the next 2 flowers and the third bouquet from the last 2 flowers.
Input: m = 2, k = 3, arr[] = [5, 5, 5, 5, 10, 5, 5]
Output: 10
Explanation: We need 2 bouquets and each bouquet should have 3 flowers, After day 5: [x, x, x, x, _, x, x], we can make one bouquet of the first three flowers that bloomed, but cannot make another bouquet. After day 10: [x, x, x, x, x, x, x], Now we can make two bouquets, taking 3 adjacent flowers in one bouquet.
Input: m = 3, k = 2, arr[] = [1, 10, 3, 10, 2]
Output: -1
Explanation: As 3 bouquets each having 2 flowers are needed, that means we need 6 flowers. But there are only 5 flowers so it is impossible to get the needed bouquets therefore -1 will be returned.
Constraints:
1 <= k <= arr.size() <= 105
1 <= m <= 105
1 <= arr[i] <= 109.

// Solution:-

class Solution {
    public static int minDaysBloom(int m, int k, int[] arr) {
        if ((long) m * k > arr.length) {
            return -1;
        }

        int left = 1;
        int right = getMax(arr);
        int result = -1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (canMakeBouquets(arr, m, k, mid)) {
                result = mid;
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

    private static boolean canMakeBouquets(int[] arr, int m, int k, int day) {
        int bouquets = 0;
        int flowers = 0;

        for (int bloomDay : arr) {
            if (bloomDay <= day) {
                flowers++;
                if (flowers == k) {
                    bouquets++;
                    flowers = 0;
                }
            } else {
                flowers = 0;
            }

            if (bouquets >= m) {
                return true;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }

    private static int getMax(int[] arr) {
        int max = arr[0];
        for (int num : arr) {
            max = Math.max(max, num);
        }
        return max;
    }
